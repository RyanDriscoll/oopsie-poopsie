          <p>
            oopsie poopsie is a version of the classic card game, oh shit. it
            can be played with anywhere from 2 to 51 players (technically), but
            it&apos;s best with 4 to 10.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mb-3">rounds</h2>
          <p>
            the number of rounds is determined by the number of cards chosen
            when the host initiates a new game. starting with five cards means
            five cards will be dealt to each player in the first round. in the
            second round, four cards are dealt, then three, two, one, and back
            up to five. so a five card game will last 9 rounds, and a ten card
            game will last 19 rounds.
          </p>
          <h2 className="mb-3">playing the game</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              cards are dealt in order, starting with the player following the
              dealer.
            </li>
            <li>
              after the cards are dealt, the next card in the deck is used to
              determine the trump suit for the round.
            </li>
            <li>
              each player must now bid for how many tricks they believe they
              will win in the round. players can bid from zero to the max number
              of tricks in the round (see bidding and scoring). start with the
              player following the dealer and bid in order.
            </li>
            <li>the player following the dealer plays a card.</li>
            <li>
              in turn, each player plays a card. if a player has a card in their
              hand that matches the suit that was lead, they must follow suit
              and play it. if not, they can play any other card, including a
              trump card if they choose.
            </li>
            <li>
              after each player has played one card, the winner of the trick is
              determined. the player who played the highest card of the suit
              that was lead wins the tick, unless trump was played. if trump was
              played because a player was not able to follow suit, the player
              who played the highest trump card wins the trick.
            </li>
            <li>the winner of the trick leads off the next trick.</li>
            <li>repeat 1-7 until all tricks in the round have been played.</li>
            <li>
              record the scores and deal the next round (see bidding and
              scoring).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h2 className="mb-3">card rank and trump</h2>
          <p>
            cards are ranked from two (lowest) to ace (highest). the trump suit
            is determined after all cards have been dealt. when a trump card is
            played, it is ranked higher than any card of the suit that was lead.
            for example, if clubs are trump and the &apos;Ace of Diamonds&apos;
            was lead, a player lacking a diamond could play the &apos;Two of
            Clubs&apos; and be in the best position to win the trick. unless a
            higher trump is played...
          </p>

          <h2 className="mb-3">bidding and scoring</h2>
          <p>
            players make their bids at the start of each round, guessing at how
            many tricks they will win. bidding begins with the player after the
            dealer, and goes in turn until it ends with the dealer. if the
            &apos;dirty bids only&apos; option was chosen when initiating the
            game, the dealer is forbidden from making a bid that would ensure
            the total bids match the total available bids. meaning, it will not
            be possible for every player to make their bid.
          </p>

          <p>
            at the end of each round, players earn 10 bonus points if they bid
            correctly, as well as one point for each trick they win. if the
            &apos;earn points for bad bids&apos; option was chosen when
            initiating the game, one point is earned for each trick won,
            regardless of whether the player made their bid correctly.
